            <p>This is a reactjs based Single Page Application</p>

            <p>The context is to allow a user to maintain an address book
                by adding, deleting and update contacts .
            </p>

            <p>We find this really interesting to work reactjs integrated wiht
                redux for state management and axios for rest-api calls, where
                rest api endpoints are provided by json-server.
            </p>
        </div>
